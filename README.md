nbv_3d_cnn_octree
=================

2024-05-28

This repository includes the nbv_3d_cnn_octree package, which was used for octree-based object completion for next best view (NBV) planning. An explanation of this package will be provided here when the related paper is published.

The repository also includes the nbv_3d_cnn package. This package was originally published in the [nbv_3d_cnn_prob](https://github.com/RMonica/nbv_3d_prob_cnn) repository to evaluate multiple NBV methods. The version of nbv_3d_cnn in this repository was extended to include the `AutocompleteOctreeIGain` and `AutocompleteVoxelgridIGain` methods, which use the new octree-based object completion. The original README for nbv_3d_cnn_prob is available [here](./README_nbv_3d_cnn.md).
